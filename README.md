# Pyme
*Now deployed on:* https://pyme-rouge.vercel.app/

Pyme is a multi-store e-commerce store front designed to support small and local businesses. Designed and built with a team of 3 developers, Pyme (short for Peque√±a y mediana empresa) was inspired by the Colombian heritage and small business ownership experience of Valentina Valverde, a developer on the team. Built with Next.js and Mongo DB, this full-stack application uses Typescript for its coding language, Clerk.js for login and Stripe for payment.

Pyme users can enjoy the experience as a small business owner hosting a storefront or as a customer purchasing quality products to support regional small businesses. Customers can enjoy a secure and quick login, an easy to navigate user experience and clean user interface to be able to find products quickly and checkout securely using Stripe.
